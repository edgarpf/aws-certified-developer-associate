* AWS requires approximately 5 weeks of usage data to generate budget forecasts
* The following list provides summary information about the different deployment policies and adds related considerations.
  * All at once – The quickest deployment method. Suitable if you can accept a short loss of service, and if quick deployments are important to you. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk deploys the new application version to each instance. Then, the web proxy or application server might need to restart. As a result, your application might be unavailable to users (or have low availability) for a short time.
  * Rolling – Avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. Suitable if you can't accept any period of completely lost service. With this method, your application is deployed to your environment one batch of instances at a time. Most bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment.
  * Rolling with additional batch – Avoids any reduced availability, at a cost of an even longer deployment time compared to the Rolling method. Suitable if you must maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk launches an extra batch of instances, then performs a rolling deployment. Launching the extra batch takes time, and ensures that the same bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment.
  * Immutable – A slower deployment method, that ensures your new application version is always deployed to new instances, instead of updating existing instances. It also has the additional advantage of a quick and safe rollback in case the deployment fails. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk performs an immutable update to deploy your application. In an immutable update, a second Auto Scaling group is launched in your environment and the new version serves traffic alongside the old version until the new instances pass health checks.
  * Traffic splitting – A canary testing deployment method. Suitable if you want to test the health of your new application version using a portion of incoming traffic, while keeping the rest of the traffic served by the old application version.
 * By default, IAM users do not have access to the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. You or your account administrator must grant users access. You can do this by activating IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console and attaching an IAM policy to your users. Then, you need to activate IAM user access for IAM policies to take effect. You only need to activate IAM user access once.
 * ALB access logs - Elastic Load Balancing provides access logs that capture detailed information about requests sent to your load balancer. Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, the client's IP address, latencies, request paths, and server responses.
 * Cognito User Pools can use JWT.
 *  You can add AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (.ebextensions directory) to your web application's source code to configure your environment and customize the AWS resources that it contains.
 *  AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR) - The AWS Serverless Application Repository is a managed repository for serverless applications. It enables teams, organizations, and individual developers to store and share reusable applications, and easily assemble and deploy serverless architectures in powerful new ways.
 *  AWS states that, if your AWS account is less than 12 months old, you can use a t2.micro instance for free within certain usage limits.
 *  KMS stores the CMK (customer master key), and receives data from the clients, which it encrypts and sends back.
 *  Parameters section of a CloudFormation template cannot be associated with Condition.
 *  An Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is a Lambda function that you provide to control access to your API. A Lambda authorizer uses bearer token authentication strategies, such as OAuth or SAML. Before creating an API Gateway Lambda authorizer, you must first create the AWS Lambda function that implements the logic to authorize and, if necessary, to authenticate the caller.
 *  Use API Gateway Mapping Templates - In API Gateway, an API's method request can take a payload in a different format from the corresponding integration request payload, as required in the backend. Similarly, vice versa is also possible. API Gateway lets you use mapping templates to map the payload from a method request to the corresponding integration request and from an integration response to the corresponding method response.
 * In DynamoDB You should note that a global secondary index (GSI) contains a selection of attributes from the base table, but they are organized by a primary key that is different from that of the table. The Global secondary indexes allow you to perform queries on attributes that are not part of the table's primary key.
 * Instead of creating individual policies for each user, you can use IAM policy variables and create a single policy that applies to multiple users (a group policy). Policy variables act as placeholders. When you make a request to AWS, the placeholder is replaced by a value from the request when the policy is evaluated.
 * AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the capability of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and AWS Regions with a single operation.
 * The following represents the correct order of steps to be followed for creating an app using AWS CDK
   * Create the app from a template provided by AWS CDK
   * Add code to the app to create resources within stacks
   * Build the app (optional)
   * Synthesize one or more stacks in the app
   * Deploy stack(s) to your AWS account 
* You can use the API Gateway console to create a new stage, or you can choose an existing stage while deploying an API. In general, you can add a new stage to an API deployment before redeploying the API.
* You can use versions to manage the deployment of your AWS Lambda functions. For example, you can publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of the stable production version. You can change the function code and settings only on the unpublished version of a function. When you publish a version, the code and most of the settings are locked to ensure a consistent experience for users of that version. You can create one or more aliases for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. You can use routing configuration on an alias to send a portion of traffic to a Lambda function version.
* Security Groups are stateful, so allowing inbound traffic to the necessary ports enables the connection. Network ACLs are stateless, so you must allow both inbound and outbound traffic.
* AM Access Analyzer - AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity. This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a security risk.
* AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) - The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
* When cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. When cross-zone load balancing is disabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic only across the registered targets in its Availability Zone. With Application Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled.
* Lambda allocates CPU power in proportion to the amount of memory configured. Memory is the amount of memory available to your Lambda function at runtime. You can increase or decrease the memory and CPU power allocated to your function using the Memory (MB) setting.
* Exported Output Values in CloudFormation must have unique names within a single Region.
* CloudFront Key Pairs - IAM users can't create CloudFront key pairs. You must log in using root credentials to create key pairs.
* IAM is used as a certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS connections in a Region that is not supported by ACM.
* CNAME records can be used to map one domain name to another.
* You can enable API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching, you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your API.
* AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.
* You can't change the queue type after you create it.
* ```!FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ]``` - The intrinsic function Fn::FindInMap returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map that is declared in the Mappings section.
* Trust policy is the only resource-based policy that the IAM service supports.
* Auto Scaling groups cannot span across multiple Regions.
* Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single-payer account.
* Time To Live (TTL) for DynamoDB allows you to define when items in a table expire so that they can be automatically deleted from the database. TTL is provided at no extra cost as a way to reduce storage usage and reduce the cost of storing irrelevant data without using provisioned throughput.
